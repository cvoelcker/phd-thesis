\chapter*{Preface}

As with all works of science, this work stands on the shoulders of giants and has been supported generously by my collaborators and advisors.
Throughout the thesis, I make references to sources for know results to the best of my knowledge.


In this thesis, I summarize and present the results of my research work conducted at the University of Toronto.
This section clarifies the individual contributions in each chapter.
My work has been published in the following papers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \autoref{chap:overestimation}: This chapter is based on \textcite{hussing2024dissecting}. I contributed as joint first author. The core insight of the paper is based on a joint brainstorming between me and Marcel Hussing based on an experiment conducted by him. The solution method was proposed and implemented by me, and tested thoroughly by Marcel Hussing. The sections on the optimizer were contributed by Marcel Hussing.
    \item \autoref{chap:vagram}: This chapter is based on \textcite{voelcker2022value}. The insights, core methodology, and experiments are my contribution.
    \item \autoref{chap:understanding}: This chapter is based on \textcite{voelcker2024when}. The insights, proofs, and experiments are my contribution. The proofs in \autoref{} are based on joint work with Tyler Kastner. 
    \item \autoref{chap:cvaml}: This chapter is based on \textcite{voelcker2025calibrated}, and an older version of the paper publicized as \textcite{voelcker2023lambda}. The insights and proofs are my contribution. The experimental architecture was coded by Anastasiia Pedan while she was working as my undergraduate student. \autoref{} was conjectured by me, the proof was sketched out by Amir-massoud Farahmand and written out and completed by me.
    \item \autoref{chap:mad-td}: This chapter is based on \textcite{voelcker2025mad}. I contributed as joint first author. The core insights of the paper were developed based on previous joint work \cite{hussing2024dissecting} and discussed between me and the second first author Marcel Hussing. The core experiments and theory were contributed by me. Writing  and additional experiments were developed collaboratively between the two joint first authors.
\end{itemize}
