While a thesis is ostensibly the work of a single author, it is the worst guarded secret of academia that no thesis would be possible without the tireless care of many, many people.

Of course, the first and perhaps biggest ``thank you'' is addressed to my supervisors who have guided me along my path for the last five years.
Without all of you, I would not be a scientist!
Amir-massoud Farahmand, thank you for pushing me constantly and tirelessly to become more precises and clear in my thinking and writing.
Your deep questions and insights were invaluable.
Animesh Garg, thank you for your enthusiasm and strong vision, and the many amazing small and large tips and tricks you have passed on to me to structure my writing and presentation.
Your knack for presenting your insights was invaluable.
Igor Gilitschenski, thank you for stepping up when I needed help and being the person I could always turn to with my frustrations and emotions.
Your calm guidance was invaluable.
Additional thanks of course goes to the amazing chair of my supervisory committee and mentor.
Wil Cunningham, thank you for your raw enthusiasm, curiosity and playfulness in exploration.
Your unbridled joy in learning new things was invaluable.
One day you will truly know how the brain works!

Getting to a PhD program is in itself a long road, and so I want to thank the undergraduate and master's professor I had the great pleasure of learning from.
A special thanks goes of course to my Darmstadt supervisor Kristian Kersting, and the two professors who mentored me and who trusted my abilities enough to write wonderful reference letters that got me to Toronto, Jan Peters, and Johannes Fuernkranz.

Since I am a person who withers without a community of peers, collaborators, and friends, the next round of thanks goes out to the collaborators and friends I have in Toronto.
To my coauthors Romina Abachi, Tyler Kastner, Victor Liao, Arash Ahmadian, Anastasiia Pedan, Jonas Guan, and and last but definitely not least, Marcel Hussing, thanks for all of your amazing work!
To the undergraduate students who worked with me, Victor Liao, Arash Ahmadian, Yash Ramani, Allan Lin, Jasper Gerig, Anastasiia Pedan, Tehilla Helfenbaum, Ian Vyse, and Shabnam Tajik, thanks for putting up with my wild and meandering ideas and good luck on all of your paths.

The next group of people is the biggest part of the acknowledgements, my dear friends and lab mates.
Roughly in order of appearance, I thank
the Adage lab and visitors, Amin, Romina, Avery, Mete, Tyler, Amarildo, and Jongmin the (late) PAIR lab, Maria and Jon, Kate, Lily, Ziyi, Mayank, and Dylan, the TISL lab and visitors, Ashkan and Sarah, Sam, Yash, Umangi, Evgenii, Jasper, Mohammad, Kai, Justin, Alfred, Shuhong, Andrei, Toshi, Axel, Eugen, and Marcel, the CleverHans lab or extended Nicola Mafia or potluck gang and visitors, Stefan, Mohammad, Avital, Sierra, Anvith, and David, friends from around Vector, Lukas, Taylor, Sep, Shalev, Lev, Luca, Yifan, and Andreas, representative for the Vector staff who were always quick to help with any problems, Abdur Mohammed and Jackie Zuborg, and finally, the great friends from all around the University of Toronto, Silvia and Gabriel, Varun, and Arthur.

Some friends have remained close since before coming to Toronto, and so a special thanks goes to Marcel, the D120 and WiMi gang, Stephan and Maria, Julian, Nadja, Benjamin, Anka, Fabian and Steffi, Johny and Franzi, and Sial, Robyn, Kai and family. Even further back, a big thanks to Victor, and the usual suspects, Philip and Feli, Ele and Flo, Ina, Kara, and Anni.

Collectively, I want to thank Queer in AI for their incredible work, and I send out all my love to those who find it harder to fight every day.
Love and community will prevail in the end.
A special thanks to Arjun, for organizing, help, and hiking.

My love goes out to Dorothee, requiescat in pace.
I had hoped I would be able to show you this.
Earlier than many others you believed in my ability to accomplish great things!

A special thanks goes to Corinne, for helping with keeping me sane in Toronto.

Of course, there are not enough words to express my thanks to my family, especially my parents, Nikola and Hinrich, and my brother and sister-in-law, Till and Jasmine.
Without your love, encouragement, and support I would have never managed to get this far (both in terms of work and sheer physical distance).

Finally, for Heiko, I have no words to adequately express everything I owe you.
Instead of words, you get me and will need to put up with me for the rest of your life.
